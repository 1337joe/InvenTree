InvenTree supports multi-language translation using the `Django Translation Framework <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/i18n/translation/>`_

Translation strings are located in the `InvenTree/locales/` directory, and translation files can be easily added here.

To set the default language, change the `langauge` setting in the `config.yaml` settings file.
